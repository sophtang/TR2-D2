This is the repository for **[TR2-D2: Tree Search Guided Trajectory-Aware Fine-Tuning for Discrete Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25171)** ðŸ¤–ðŸŒ³. It is partially built on the **[PepTune repo](https://github.com/programmablebio/peptune)** ([Tang et al. 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17780)) and **MDNS** ([Zhu et al. 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10684)).

Inspired by the incredible success of off-policy reinforcement learning (RL), **TR2-D2** introduces a general framework that enhances the performance of off-policy RL with tree search for discrete diffusion fine-tuning.

ðŸ¤–Â Off-policy RL enables learning from diffusion trajectories from the non-gradient tracking policy model by storing sampling trajectories in a replay buffer for repeated use. 

ðŸŒ³Â Tree search balances exploration and exploitation to generate optimal diffusion trajectories, and stores the optimal sequences in the buffer. 

We use this framework to develop an efficient discrete diffusion fine-tuning strategy that leverages **Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)** to curate a replay buffer of optimal trajectories combined with an **off-policy control-based RL algorithm grounded in stochastic optimal control theory**, yielding theoretically guaranteed convergence to the optimal distribution. ðŸŒŸ

### Regulatory DNA Sequence Design ðŸ§¬

---

In this experiment, we fine-tune the pre-trained **DNA enhancer MDM from DRAKES** (Wang et al. 2025) trained on **~700k HepG2 sequences** to optimize the measured enhancer activity using the reward oracles from DRAKES. Code and instructions to reproduce our results are provided in `/tr2d2-dna`.

### Multi-Objective Therapeutic Peptide Design ðŸ§«

---

In this experiment, we fine-tune the pre-trained **unconditional peptide SMILES MDM from PepTune** ([Tang et al. 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17780)) to optimize **multiple therapeutic properties**, including target protein binding affinity, solubility, non-hemolysis, non-fouling, and permeability. We show that one-shot generation from the fine-tuned policy outperforms inference-time multi-objective guidance, marking a significant advance over prior fine-tuning methods. Code and instructions to reproduce our results are provided in `/tr2d2-pep`.
